Quran Study application

This is _supposed to be_ a platform-independent [Gtk+]-based application (actually developed in [gtkmm])
that provides functionality similar to [al-anvar] and [Zekr].

The focus is on the text of Quran, its translation and commentary,
as well as providing Markdown-based note-taking capabilities.

[al-anvar]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/al-anvar/
[Zekr]: http://zekr.org/
